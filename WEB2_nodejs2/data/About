  Hi, I'm Cooldong!<br> Let me introduce myself.
  Before I learn <span id="setBlue">Mechanical Engineering.</span><br>
  I'm interested in swords and guns.<br>
  I did KENDO about 3 years when I was young. So I love brandish katana on the mountain.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-top:25px">
  I also loves toy guns that shoot BB bullet. <br>
  Companies goods look good, but something can't catch my mine.<br>
  So, I decided to make myself.<br>
  I has studied guns in games. And I did <span>Military Duty</span> 2years.<br>
  That effort, learning firearms, makes me not to stop trying.<br>
</p>
<p style="margin-top:25px">
  I went to university to design mechanism. <br>
  Then, I bought <span class="js">3d printers</span> to make mechanical parts. <br>
  After several challenges that break and build, now I made first result.<br>
  That will show in my test web page.
