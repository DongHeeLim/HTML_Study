<h3>Adjustable Stock</h3>
3d printer material is PETG. It's quiet good for print big size but so weak to portable.<br>
So, the rifle became model guns that can't go outside.<br>
Stock has 3 linear pipes that allows size change.<br>
Also It has cheek pad. The final version of cheek pad can adjust up and down by handy turning bolt.
