<h3>안전트리거</h3>
  <p>
  when I first met <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2RDitgCaD0" target="_blank" title="Glock Mechanism">Glock</a> series.<br>
  There was <strong><u>safe</u> tigger</strong> that allows people to shot exactly.<br>
  I took that parts to my safe trigger for making rifles.<br>
  I made it by 3d printer. So, it looks quiet thick.

  First, you need 8mm springs.
  If you make this part strong material. It can be more thin.
