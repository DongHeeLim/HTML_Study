    Hi, I'm Cooldong!<br> Let me introduce myself.
    Before I learn <span id="second" style="font-weight:bold;">Mechanical Engineering.</span><br>
    I'm interested in <span>swords and guns.</span><br>
    I did KENDO about 3 years when I was young. So I love brandish katana on the mountain.<br>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-top:25px">
    I also loves toy guns that shoot BB bullet. <br>
    Companies goods look good, but something can't catch my mine.<br>
    So, I decided to make myself.<br>
    I has studied guns in games. And I did <span id="first" class="js">Military Duty 2years.</span><br>
    That effort, learning firearms, makes me not to stop trying.<br>
  </p>
  <p style="margin-top:25px">
    I went to university to design mechanism. <br>
    Then, I bought <span class="js">3d printers</span> to make mechanical parts. <br>
    After several challenges that break and build, now I made first result.<br>
    That will show in my test web page.
